prebuild-jboss-7.x-srpm - RPM tools for pre-built JBoss AS binary tarball

This github repo tools for packaging the pre-built, upsteam
JBoss AS 7.1.1 tarball into an RPM and SRPM. It does not build from
scratch, but is entirely reliant on the upstream package content.

JBoss AS 7.1.1 RPM's are available, built from scratch, for current
Fedora releases, but the necessary toolchain is much too long for a
normal RHELL 6 or earlier package.
